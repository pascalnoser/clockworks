Description: clockworks is an R package for streamlined rhythmicity detection in 
    time-series data. It serves as a wrapper for several popular analysis tools, 
    eliminating the need to wrangle data into tool-specific formats or learn 
    each method’s quirks. With simple, consistent inputs, clockworks can 
    automatically adjust parameters based on the input data and prevent the use 
    of methods unsuited to your dataset. In just a few lines of code, the user 
    can easily run multiple methods, compare results, and generate basic 
    visualizations.
