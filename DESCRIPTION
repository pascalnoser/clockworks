Description: clockworks is an R package for streamlined rhythmicity detection in 
    time-series data. It serves as a wrapper for several popular analysis tools, 
    eliminating the need to wrangle data into tool-specific formats or learn 
    each methodâ€™s quirks. With simple, consistent inputs, clockworks can 
    automatically adjust parameters based on the input data and prevent the use 
    of methods unsuited to your dataset. In just a few lines of code, the user 
    can easily run multiple methods, compare results, and generate basic 
    visualizations.
